How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Easily see the changes made without comparing the files line by line manually.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

You can compare and restore any previous version easily. This can help because you will know what has changed and you can change back without modifiy current version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Only save versions that are meaningful to avoid too many.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

In some cases, multiple files are related with each other, and changing one will affect the other, or changing more than one is necessary to make a significant modification.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

First use git log to find the version then use git diff to compare the two version using commit id

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Using version control you can make changes to previous version without changing the current version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Version-control!! GOOD
